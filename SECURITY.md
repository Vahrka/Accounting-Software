## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Discuss the Vulnerability:**  
   Before submitting a report, please open a discussion in our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bambier/Accounting-Software//issues) to describe the vulnerability. This allows us to evaluate the issue and determine if it requires further investigation.

2. **Submit a Formal Report (If Accepted):**  
   If the vulnerability is accepted after the initial discussion, you will be asked to submit a formal report via email. Include the following details:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any relevant screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept code.

3. **Response Timeline:**  
   - You will receive an initial response within **150 hours** of the formal report submission.
   - We will provide regular updates on the progress of resolving the vulnerability.

4. **Outcome:**  
   - If the vulnerability is accepted, we will prioritize a fix and notify you once it has been resolved.  
   - If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide a clear explanation of our decision.  

5. **Disclosure Policy:**  
   We kindly ask that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had sufficient time to address it. We will coordinate with you on the appropriate timing for public disclosure, if applicable.
